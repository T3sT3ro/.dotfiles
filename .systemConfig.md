# Global notes about the system configuration

## Gradle

For now github doesn't support public repos, so a token with read-repositories permission must be present when trying to connect to any repository from GH. Thus I added some variables to the `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` with said token

## Things I added:

- PS1 customization in .prompt.sh. 
    - It uses git prompt and detects the ssh status (sets REMOTE variable)
    - It uses /usr/lib/git-core/git-sh-prompt
- installed intellij theme for vim and kotlin's(?) language detection
- installed tmux and configured it's activator to C-a (same as screen)
- Glow - CLI markdown renderer
- CUDA docker image
- GO: 
    - installed to `/usr/local`, set up PATH in `/etc/profile`
    - removed `~/go`
- n - Node package manager
    - removed existing node and npm packages installed with apt
    - installed n to `~/.n` and set up `N_PREFIX`
    - added symlink `~/.n/lib/node -> ~/.n/lib/node_modules` to be able to require global packages in REPL
- 'ffmpeg-progressbar-cli' npm global package -- a wrapper for ffmpeg that shows bar and ETA: (https://github.com/sidneys/ffmpeg-progressbar-cli)
- Edited the /etc/skel/.prompt.sh and .bashrc to use it. I want to avoid editing the 'etc/bash.bashrc' file
- Short bash prompt displays in multiline with more info 

## Dotfiles:

I manage dotfiles by running `dotfiles` command which is aliased to some smart git working on bare repo in `~/.git`

## Interesting things to check out:

- Nix as an easy alternative to docker
- Charm as a library under Glow for managing encrypted files
