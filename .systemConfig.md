# Global notes about the system configuration 

## Notes, tip

- `<Enter>, ~, .` to kill ssh session that hunged up. (dot kills)
- rendering with GPU offload support (multiMC "wrapper command" without final program name):  
  ```
  env __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia someProgramName
  ```

## Gradle

For now github doesn't support public repos, so a token with read-repositories permission must be present when trying to connect to any repository from GH. Thus I added some variables to the `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` with said token

## Things I changed:

- added flatpak repo:
    - MenuLibre (for editing menu icons)
- PS1 customization in .prompt.sh. 
    - ~~It uses git prompt and detects the ssh status (sets REMOTE variable)
    - It uses /usr/lib/git-core/git-sh-prompt
    - .promptrc has basic configuration~~
    - I now use [starship](https://starship.rs/guide/) to avoid breaking terminal in mny ways

- 'ffmpeg-progressbar-cli' npm global package -- a wrapper for ffmpeg that shows bar and ETA: (https://github.com/sidneys/ffmpeg-progressbar-cli)
- Edited the /etc/skel/.prompt.sh and .bashrc to use it. I want to avoid editing the 'etc/bash.bashrc' file
- Short bash prompt displays in multiline with more info 
- Wireguard and Openvpn configs to use on prask
- coz-profiler -- maybe also use (stabilizer)[https://github.com/ccurtsinger/stabilizer]

- replaced PulseAudio using PipeWire (using guide from <https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2022/04/pipewire-replace-pulseaudio-ubuntu-2204/>)
    - enabled auto-switch module in `/usr/share/pipewire/pipewire-pulse.conf` 
- enabled system prober in GRUB
- installed `preload` daemon
- installed `reptyr` - to reattach process to different parent (so that normal terminal task can be reattached to tmux)
- installed `gtk-3-examples` - https://askubuntu.com/questions/685507/where-are-my-gtk-3-examples
- installed `encfs`
- installed `gdbgui`
- installed `gpm` - [github package manager](https://github.com/aerys/gpm)
- installed `glow` for displaying markdown docsi nterminal
- installed `btop` [from binary release](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop)
- installed `pipx` and `python3.10-venv`
- installed `sqlitebrowser` and `sqlite3`
- added thumbnailers for .ora .kra .psd .xcf, (the xcf one is missing xcf2png to work)
- Installed [`ratarmount`](https://github.com/mxmlnkn/ratarmount#usage) into `/usr/local/bin/ratarmount`
- installed `binwalk`
- installed `touchegg` deb for 3-finger gestures on X. Remove this when migrating to wayland
  - also with it installed x11 gestures extension
- installed [`sourcegraph`](https://about.sourcegraph.com/) - intelligent source code index, soon with AI and `sourcegraph cli` as global npm module
- installed `ffmpegthumbnailer` and `gstreamer1.0-libav`, disabled totem thumbnailer inside `/usr/share/thumbnailers/totem.thumbnailer` (it was crashing)
- installed my formatter and aliased it with `f`
- configured cpan for perl modules
    - installed Regexp::Grammars for parsing
- added `Experimental = true` to `/etc/bluetooth/main.conf` to enable displaying bluetooth devices power in power settings
- installed [`scvlens`](https://github.com/YS-L/csvlens)
- disabled the default `/usr/share/thumbnailers/gdk-pixbuf-thumbnailer` and superseeded it with the `pixelart.thumbnailer` in the same directory. Added linked `/usr/local/bin/pixelart-thumbnailer` script, which creates thumbnails that generates pixel-art thumbnail with filter=point if it's under certain size (thumbnail size %s). This makes displaying small pixelart textures crisp.
- `~/.selected_editor` has vim.gtk3 now to support clipboard in different programs like `anacron -e`
- ~~installed (a long time ago) [`webi`](https://webinstall.dev)~~
    - ~~installed [`pathman`](https://webinstall.dev/pathman/) for managing path entries (automatically)~~
    - ~~installed `bat`~~
    - ~~installed `fd`, a `find` on steroids~~
    - ~~installed `lsd`, an `ls` and `tree` on steroids (although tree is not that performant)~~
    - ~~installed `xsv` for quick csv editing in CLI~~
    - ! removed webi as it made locating info about packages/programs impossible and confusing. Without remembering there was no way of knowing if a program was installed with webi
- added `.alsoftrc` to configure OpenAL to use pulseaudio driver by default instead of JACK. This cames from [this github issue](https://github.com/henkelmax/sound-physics-remastered/issues/199)
- moved from [tldr++](https://github.com/isacikgoz/tldr) to node client [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr-node-client)
    - no special reason, I just did it during upgrade to zsh.
    - the difference is that the first has interactive selection, but sometimes locked terminal input for some reason. The first one was also faster at the time.
- installed [`diff-so-fancy`](https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy) and configured as a default git diff pager 
- installed `lazygit`, configured to use `difft` by default as a diff tool
- git now uses `difft` by default
- installed miniconda for various AI work
    - added `~/.condarc` to disable activation of base conda environment
    - to configure: use `conda [de]activate`
- removed Ora snap, it's available as a webapp, and it's freemium so I don't use it often
- installed blender and godot flatpaks
- removed kdenlive, I may install it from flathub one day but I don't need it for now
- removed all snaps and snapd [this way](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1170688/how-to-completely-remove-snap-and-replace-with-flatpak/1384366#1384366):
    - blockbench
    - ora
    - blender
    - and others...
- added auto commands for opening gpg encrypted files in nvim
- removed `postfix`, gnome app for email (E-something)
- installed `nala`
    - configured `/etc/nala/nala.con` to `apt upgrade` instead of `apt full-upgrade`
- installed packages:
    - `libimage-exiftool-perl` for exiftools
    - `ubuntu-restricted-extras` for codecs and M$ true type fonts
    - somehow support for webp in gnome
    - `libavif-gdk-pixbuf` in the hopes of supporting avif in image viewers and thumbnailers
- set `export MUTTER_DEBUG_KMS_THREAD_TYPE=user` in the `/etc/environment` to solve the mutter issue in ubuntu 24 where I can't login to wayland unless I switch to TTY and back
- installed `fzf` by cloning into `~/.fzf` and doing `install`
- added `.config/xkb` custom CAPS handling, and it should work out of the box on wayland.
    - this is a PITA to configure on Xorg so I edited `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc` and changed the CAPS key

## To backup:

- gnome shortcuts
- app list
- /etc/skel ?
- groups
- cron and anacron jobs
- ssh keys and configurations
- compose comnfigurations for X
- saved network settings
- many different config files annotated with 'tooster' - best bet is to look for strings across system
- XCompose

## Dotfiles:

I manage dotfiles by running `dotfiles` command which is aliased to some smart git working on bare repo in `~/.git`
