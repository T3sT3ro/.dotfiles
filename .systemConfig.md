# Global notes about the system configuration

## Gradle

For now github doesn't support public repos, so a token with read-repositories permission must be present when trying to connect to any repository from GH. Thus I added some variables to the `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` with said token

## Things I added:

- Glow - CLI markdown renderer
- CUDA docker image
- GO: 
    - installed to `/usr/local`, set up PATH in `/etc/profile`
    - removed `~/go`
- n - Node package manager
    - removed existing node and npm packages installed with apt
    - installed n to `~/.n` and set up `N_PREFIX`

## Dotfiles:

I manage dotfiles by running `dotfiles` command which is aliased to some smart git working on bare repo in `~/.git`

## Interesting things to check out:

- Nix as an easy alternative to docker
- Charm as a library under Glow for managing encrypted files
