# Global notes about the system configuration 

## Notes, tip

- `<Enter>, ~, .` to kill ssh session that hunged up. (dot kills)
- rendering with GPU offload support (multiMC "wrapper command" without final program name):  
  ```
  env __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia someProgramName
  ```

## Gradle

For now github doesn't support public repos, so a token with read-repositories permission must be present when trying to connect to any repository from GH. Thus I added some variables to the `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` with said token

## Things I changed:

- added flatpak repo:
    - MenuLibre (for editing menu icons)
- PS1 customization in .prompt.sh. 
    - It uses git prompt and detects the ssh status (sets REMOTE variable)
    - It uses /usr/lib/git-core/git-sh-prompt
    - .promptrc has basic configuration
- vim:
    - installed intellij theme for vim and kotlin's(?) language detection
    - installed Vundle plugin manager (see .vimrc)
    - installed NERDTree
- installed tmux
    - C-a activator on locahlost
    - C-b on remote
- Glow - CLI markdown renderer
- CUDA docker image
- SSH:
    - installed Mosh client to roam and reconnect to ssh sessions on unstable connections
- GO: 
    - installed to `/usr/local`, set up PATH in `/etc/profile`
    - removed `~/go`
- n - Node package manager
    - removed existing node and npm packages installed with apt
    - installed n to `~/.n` and set up `N_PREFIX`
    - added symlink `~/.n/lib/node -> ~/.n/lib/node_modules` to be able to require global packages in REPL
- 'ffmpeg-progressbar-cli' npm global package -- a wrapper for ffmpeg that shows bar and ETA: (https://github.com/sidneys/ffmpeg-progressbar-cli)
- Edited the /etc/skel/.prompt.sh and .bashrc to use it. I want to avoid editing the 'etc/bash.bashrc' file
- Short bash prompt displays in multiline with more info 
- Wireguard and Openvpn configs to use on prask
- coz-profiler -- maybe also use (stabilizer)[https://github.com/ccurtsinger/stabilizer]
- `XF86Ungrab` or something similar.` Do Ctrl + Alt + Num /` to ungrab/unfreeze mouse (`*` to kill process as well)
- Papirus icons and themes for apps
- installed and later removed KDE
- installed and later removed nemo
- better desktop icons addon
- [folder colors addon](http://foldercolor.tuxfamily.org/)
- [installed Fluent icons and theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Fluent-gtk-theme)
- markdown like formatter and more - [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich)
- removed autojump in favor of zoxide
- installed `reptyr` - to reattach process to different parent (so that normal terminal task can be reattached to tmux)
- installed `gtk-3-examples` - https://askubuntu.com/questions/685507/where-are-my-gtk-3-examples
- installed `encfs`
- installed `gdbgui`
- installed `gpm` - [github package manager](https://github.com/aerys/gpm)
- installed `glow` for displaying markdown docsi nterminal
- installed `btop` [from binary release](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop)
- installed renderdoc (and configured vulkan layer system wide with `./renderdoccmd vylkanlayer --register --system`)
- added compose keys for greek in ~/.XCompose with `CC-G-[Q-][A-Z]`
- installed rust and cargo
    cargo packages:
    - xplr
    - ferium
- installed vagrant
- installed lxc
- installed firejail
- installed checkinstall
- installed aptitude
- installed debian bullseye using deboostrap into `/target`
- installed `preload` daemon
- added ppa for webp viewing and setup a thumbnailer in the ~/.local/share/thumbnailers
- replaced PulseAudio using PipeWire (using guide from <https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2022/04/pipewire-replace-pulseaudio-ubuntu-2204/>)
    - enabled auto-switch module in `/usr/share/pipewire/pipewire-pulse.conf` 
- enabled system prober in GRUB
- installed `pipx` and `python3.10-venv`
- installed `sqlitebrowser` and `sqlite3`
- added thumbnailers for .ora .kra .psd .xcf, (the xcf one is missing xcf2png to work)
- Installed [`ratarmount`](https://github.com/mxmlnkn/ratarmount#usage) into `/usr/local/bin/ratarmount`
- installed `binwalk`
- installed `touchegg` deb for 3-finger gestures on X. Remove this when migrating to wayland
  - also with it installed x11 gestures extension
- installed [`sourcegraph`](https://about.sourcegraph.com/) - intelligent source code index, soon with AI and `sourcegraph cli` as global npm module
- installed `ffmpegthumbnailer` and `gstreamer1.0-libav`, disabled totem thumbnailer inside `/usr/share/thumbnailers/totem.thumbnailer` (it was crashing)
- installed my formatter and aliased it with `f`
- configured cpan for perl modules
    - installed Regexp::Grammars for parsing
- added `Experimental = true` to `/etc/bluetooth/main.conf` to enable displaying bluetooth devices power in power settings
- installed [`scvlens`](https://github.com/YS-L/csvlens)
- disabled the default `/usr/share/thumbnailers/gdk-pixbuf-thumbnailer` and superseeded it with the `pixelart.thumbnailer` in the same directory. Added linked `/usr/local/bin/pixelart-thumbnailer` script, which creates thumbnails that generates pixel-art thumbnail with filter=point if it's under certain size (thumbnail size %s). This makes displaying small pixelart textures crisp.
- `~/.selected_editor` has vim.gtk3 now to support clipboard in different programs like `anacron -e`
- installed (a long time ago) [`webi`](https://webinstall.dev)
    - installed [`pathman`](https://webinstall.dev/pathman/) for managing path entries (automatically)
    - installed `bat`
    - installed `fd`, a `find` on steroids
    - installed `lsd`, an `ls` and `tree` on steroids (although tree is not that performant)
    - installed `xsv` for quick csv editing in CLI
- added `.alsoftrc` to configure OpenAL to use pulseaudio driver by default instead of JACK. This cames from [this github issue](https://github.com/henkelmax/sound-physics-remastered/issues/199)
    
## To backup:

- gnome shortcuts
- app list
- /etc/skel ?
- groups
- cron and anacron jobs
- ssh keys and configurations
- compose comnfigurations for X
- saved network settings
- many different config files annotated with 'tooster' - best bet is to look for strings across system

## Dotfiles:

I manage dotfiles by running `dotfiles` command which is aliased to some smart git working on bare repo in `~/.git`

## Interesting things to check out:

- Nix as an easy alternative to docker
- Charm as a library under Glow for managing encrypted files
