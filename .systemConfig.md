# Global notes about the system configuration 

## Notes, tip

- `<Enter>, ~, .` to kill ssh session that hunged up. (dot kills)

## Gradle

For now github doesn't support public repos, so a token with read-repositories permission must be present when trying to connect to any repository from GH. Thus I added some variables to the `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` with said token

## Things I changed:

- added flatpak repo:
    - MenuLibre (for editing menu icons)
- PS1 customization in .prompt.sh. 
    - It uses git prompt and detects the ssh status (sets REMOTE variable)
    - It uses /usr/lib/git-core/git-sh-prompt
    - .promptrc has basic configuration
- vim:
    - installed intellij theme for vim and kotlin's(?) language detection
    - installed Vundle plugin manager (see .vimrc)
    - installed NERDTree
- installed tmux
    - C-a activator on locahlost
    - C-b on remote
- Glow - CLI markdown renderer

    - installed Mosh client to roam and reconnect to ssh sessions on unstable connections
- GO: 
    - installed to `/usr/local`, set up PATH in `/etc/profile`
    - removed `~/go`
- n - Node package manager
    - removed existing node and npm packages installed with apt
    - installed n to `~/.n` and set up `N_PREFIX`
    - added symlink `~/.n/lib/node -> ~/.n/lib/node_modules` to be able to require global packages in REPL
- 'ffmpeg-progressbar-cli' npm global package -- a wrapper for ffmpeg that shows bar and ETA: (https://github.com/sidneys/ffmpeg-progressbar-cli)
- Edited the /etc/skel/.prompt.sh and .bashrc to use it. I want to avoid editing the 'etc/bash.bashrc' file
- Short bash prompt displays in multiline with more info 
- Wireguard and Openvpn configs to use on prask
- coz-profiler -- maybe also use (stabilizer)[https://github.com/ccurtsinger/stabilizer]

## To backup:

- gnome shortcuts

- /etc/skel ?
- groups

## Dotfiles:

I manage dotfiles by running `dotfiles` command which is aliased to some smart git working on bare repo in `~/.git`
